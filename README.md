## Method
The following steps will be followed to achieve the goal:

- Importing Libraries and Familiarizing Ourselves With the Data
- Combining the Test and Training Datasets
- Cleaning the Data - Dealing with Null Values
- Feature Transformations
- Encoding & Scaling
- Transforming our Target
- Resplitting the Data into Training & Test sets
- Choosing our Model
- Training our Models
- Evaluating our Models Using Cross Validation
- Making Predictions
